//! Cross-platform microphone capture.
//!
//! Handy Recorder owns the real-time audio path. It gives applications audio
//! in the format they asked for, on an ordinary thread, reporting when audio
//! was lost or the stream broke.
//!
//! # Concepts
//!
//! - A [`Recorder`] is an open microphone; `start` and `stop` bracket each
//!   recording.
//! - A [`Sink`] is application code that receives the recording's audio as
//!   fixed-size [`AudioChunk`]s. It is lent to the library by `start` and
//!   handed back by `stop`.
//! - Errors: match on [`ErrorKind`]; its docs say what to do for each.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use handy_recorder::{CollectingSink, Recorder, RecorderConfig};
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), handy_recorder::Error> {
//! let recorder = Recorder::open_with_failure_handler(RecorderConfig::speech(), |error| {
//!     // Runs on a library thread. `stop` still returns the audio captured so far.
//!     eprintln!("microphone failed: {error}");
//! })?;
//!
//! recorder.start(CollectingSink::new())?;
//! std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5));
//!
//! let stopped = recorder.stop()?;
//! if !stopped.is_complete() {
//!     // The mic failed or audio was dropped. What was captured is still here.
//!     eprintln!("incomplete recording: {:?}", stopped.end_reason);
//! }
//! let samples = stopped.sink.into_samples();
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
