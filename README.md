# handy-recorder

Simple cross-platform microphone capture for Rust. Extracted from [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy).

Opens a mic at whatever format the OS has it set to, and hands your code fixed-size chunks of audio at the rate and channel layout you asked for, on an ordinary thread. It tells you when audio was lost or the device broke instead of quietly giving you silence.

- macOS (CoreAudio), Windows (WASAPI), Linux (PulseAudio / pipewire-pulse, ALSA fallback)
- resampling, mix-to-mono or single-channel selection, fixed chunk sizes
- device loss, stalls, no-audio, and sleep are detected and reported

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
handy-recorder = "0.1"
```

```rust
use handy_recorder::{CollectingSink, Recorder, RecorderConfig};

let recorder = Recorder::open_with_failure_handler(RecorderConfig::speech(), |error| {
    eprintln!("microphone failed: {error}");
})?;

recorder.start(CollectingSink::new())?;
std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(5));
let stopped = recorder.stop()?;

let samples = stopped.sink.into_samples(); // 16 kHz mono f32
```

`RecorderConfig::speech()` is 16 kHz mono in 480-frame chunks. Implement `Sink` to stream audio somewhere instead of collecting it.

## Node.js, Bun, and Deno

`bindings/node` is the npm package `@handy-computer/recorder`; see its [README](bindings/node/README.md).

## macOS < 14.2

CPAL links two CoreAudio functions that only exist on macOS 14.2+. If your binary needs to launch on older macOS, weak-link CoreAudio, e.g. in `.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")']
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-Wl,-weak_framework,CoreAudio"]
```

This goes away once CPAL loads those functions at runtime.
